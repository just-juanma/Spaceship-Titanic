## ðŸŒŒ Project Description <a name="pdescription"></a>
In this project my task was to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. To help me make these predictions, I had a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system.
For making this, I divided the project into 5 parts:
### First part. Data analysis
We looked for missing values, cardinalities. We made graphs of different distributions and from that, we generated new categories.
### Second part. Pre-processing of the data
Missing values management and feature encoding for the third part.
### Third part. Model construction
The first algorithms were built for statistical purposes to verify those with better performance.
### Fourth part. Choice of Hyper Parameters
For the best models, some parameters were adjusted manually.
### Part 5. Test Set Prediction
Generation of the prediction and brief observation.
